You are building a new Next.js (TypeScript) feature. RULE: reuse our existing components and patterns first.

Goal:
<describe the feature and the user role>

Context:
- Next.js router: <App Router or Pages Router>
- Styling: <Tailwind / CSS modules / other>
- Data: <API endpoint(s) or mock>

Before writing code:
1) List what to search for to reuse (component names/paths/patterns).
2) If something is missing, propose a new internal component (minimal) instead of raw HTML.

Output:
- Plan (short)
- Files to touch (tree)
- Code per file
- UX states: loading/empty/error
- Checklist: design-system compliance + a11y
